## Showcase

There's a showcase at <a href="https://pdfviewer.net">https://pdfviewer.net</a>.

## Breaking changes

0.9.47 introduces a small breaking change: [showHandTool] now is false by default, while [handTool] is true by default. This allows it to deactivate the CPU-intensive text layer by default.

## Bringing PDF to the Angular world

This library provides an embeddable PDF viewer component. It's different from other approaches like [ng2-pdf-viewer](https://vadimdez.github.io/ng2-pdf-viewer/) in that it shows the full suite of UI widgets. In other words, it looks exactly like the PDF viewer of your browser:

## Features

- Searching (even programatically)
- Printing
- Sidebar with thumbails, outlines, and attachments
- Rotating
- Download and upload
- Zoom (with optional two-way binding to an attribute)
- Full-screen mode
- various selection tools
- standard display or even / odd spreads (like a book)
- several event listeners
- various approaches to scrolling (vertical, horizontal, "wrapped" scrolling)
- Internationalization (providing translations to several dozen languages)
- plus the ability to deactivate each of these features.

Not to mention the ability to display PDF files, running on Mozilla's pdf.js 2.1.266. Or even pdf.js 2.2.199, if you want to try a developer snapshot of the next version.

## Alternatives

If you only need the base functionality, I'll happily pass you to [the project of Vadym Yatsyuk](https://github.com/vadimdez/ng2-pdf-viewer/). Vadym does a great job delivering a no-nonsense PDF viewer. However, if you need something that can easily pass as the native viewer on a gloomy day, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is your friend.

There's also a direct counterpart to my library: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer" target="#">ng2-pdfjs-viewer</a>. As far as I can see, it's also a good library. Recently (May 24, 2019), it has been updated to PDF.js 2.2.171. If wraps the PDF viewer in an iFrame. That's a more reliable approach, but it also offers less options. The list of attributes is shorter, and the PDF viewer can't emit events to your application.

You might also try to use the native PDF viewer of your browser. That's a valid approach. Actually, it's even the preferred approach. The advantages of both ngx-extended-pdf-viewer and ng2-pdfjs-viewer are they also support Internet Explorer 11 (with some help of the polyfills). ngx-extended-pdf-viewer also gives you a wide range of options that aren't available using the native API.

## State of the art

I'm using the library in production, and it has been downloaded so many times I assume countless other developers are using it in production, too. Even so: use at own risk. I consider the library a professional-grade leisure time project. I'll answer your bug tickets as soon as possible, but there's nothing in the way of warranties.

The library has originally been developed with Angular 6. Recently, I've updated it to Angular 8, but I've never tested it with earlier versions of Angular. So I've configure npm to complain complain if you're using
an older version of Angular (i.e. Angular 2-5). In theory, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer should be compatible with
every Angular version since 2.0, but I don't support this actively. If you're using such a configuration, please share your experience with me, so the greater Angular community benefits from your success (or failure) story. Thanks in advance!

## Known bugs

Mozilla's PDF viewer suffers from several memory leaks. Currently, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer inherits these leaks (or I didn't find out yet how to remove the viewer from memory properly). If you know how to solve the bug, please leave a message at [the corresponding issue on GitHub](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/12). Any help is appreciated!

There's also a layout glitch that seems to be intentional: you may need to set the font size of the input field containing the page number explicitely. By default, it's a lot larger than the rest of the text of the toolbar in some applications.

## Unknown bugs

If you run into problems using &lt;ngx-extended-pdf-viewer&gt;, please open an issue on the [project bug tracker](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ExploringAngular/tree/master/embedding-pdf).

## Compatibility to Bootstrap (and other CSS frameworks)

Bootstrap interferes with the printing algorithm of pdf.js. Guard it with a media query to avoid unwanted effects, such as scaling the print to 65%. For example, if you're using SCSS and Bootstrap 4, remove the import of Bootstrap.min.css from the Angular.json file. Instead, import it by including Bootstrap by adding this line to the global `styles.scss` file:

```css
@media screen {
  @import '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
}
```

## Internet Explorer 11 (and old versions of the "evergreen browsers")

ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is compatible to Internet Explorer 11. Just don't forget to activate your polyfills. Or - even better - use the clever approach of the Angular CLI 7.3+ to import the polyfills automatically if and only if they are needed (see [my article on Angular 7.3 polyfills](https://beyondjava.net/what-happened-to-the-polyfills). Otherwise, you'll end up with an error message like this:

```
SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method `fill`
```

## Beware of timing problems!

The PDF viewer is very prone to timing problems:

- Hiding and re-displaying a PDF quickly (or vice versa) results in errors. This is because the bulk of pdf.js works asynchronously. It takes some time to initialize the widget. If it's destroyed while still being initialized, you run into problems. The same happens if it's initialized while an earliers instand is still being destroyed.
- Putting PDFs in tab frequently causes this problem. Switching between tabs often means that the content of one of the tabs is hidden. At the same time, the content of the new tab is shown. I've observed this when using @angular/material. The solution is to hide the first tab and to show the new tab after a timeout, as demonstrated in [the demo project](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/tree/master/src/app).

```html
<mat-tab-group (selectedTabChange)="activateTab($event.index)">
  <mat-tab label="BootsFAces Deep-Dive PDF">
    <ng-template matTabContent>
      <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer *ngIf="visible[0]" [src]="'assets/pdfs/BootsFaces_Deep_Dive_1.0.pdf'"> </ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
    </ng-template>
  </mat-tab>
  <mat-tab label="Codpaste PDF">
    <ng-template matTabContent>
      <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer *ngIf="visible[1]" [src]="'assets/pdfs/codpaste-teachingpack.pdf'"> </ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
    </ng-template>
  </mat-tab>
</mat-tab-group>
```

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  public visible = { 0: true };

  public activateTab(tab: number): void {
    this.hideOtherPDFs();
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.visible[tab] = true;
    }, 100);
  }

  public hideOtherPDFs(): void {
    console.log('Hiding');
    this.visible[0] = false;
    this.visible[1] = false;
  }
}
```

## Memory footprint

It's a bit difficult to measure, but the library seems to add a hefty 1445 KB of disk space. Gzipping reduces this to 476 KB.
(The precise numbers may differ between versions. The base library, PDF.js, tends to grow with each version).

## How to use the library

There's a minimalistic demo project at https://github.com/stephanrauh/ExploringAngular/tree/master/embedding-pdf. A slightly more advanced demo project is hosted [in the repository of the library](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/tree/master/src/app).

Basically, there are (at least) two ways to create an Angular application: you can use the Angular tooling (ng new), or you can have it generated by JHipster. JHipster replaces the entire Angular build chain by their own webpack scripts. So there are two slightly different approaches:

1.  Install the library with npm i ngx-extended-pdf-viewer --save
    2.a. (CLI users only) Open the file "angular.json" (or ".angular-cli.json" if you're using an older version of Angular)
    and add these three JavaScript files to the "scripts" section:

                "scripts": [
                  "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.js",
                  "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.worker.js",
                  "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/viewer.js"
                ]

    If you're the adventurous one, you can also add the next version of pdf.js. Note that this version is a developer snapshat instead of a stable release. It's not intended to be used in production yet. Plus, the version number may change with each release of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. That said, here's how to have a glimpse of the future:

                "scripts": [
                  "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf-2.2.199.js",
                  "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.worker-2.2.199.js",
                  "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/viewer-2.2.199.js"
                ]

2.b. (CLI users only) Add the translations to the assets by adding them to the "assets" section in the angular.json:

            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets",
              {
                "glob": "**/*",
                "input": "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/locale",
                "output": "/assets/locale/"
              }
            ]

    If you need only one language, you can reduce the list to 'locale.properties' and your language folder.

    _Hint:_ There are two ways to define the language files needed for the labels of the buttons and screen elements of the PDF viewer. The second method is described below in the "internationalization" section.

3.a. (Webpack and JHipster users only) Locate the `CopyWebpackPlugin` in the file `webpack.common.js` (currently line 70) and add this line:

```js
    new CopyWebpackPlugin([
      { from: "./node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/locale", to: 'content/assets/locale' },
```

3.b. (Webpack and JHipster users only) Copy the files `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.worker.js` and `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.js` manually to `src/main/webcontent/app`.

3.c. (Webpack and JHipster users only) Copy the file `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/viewer.js` manually to a new folder `src/main/webcontent/app/web`.

3.d. (Webpack and JHipster users only) Add these lines to the imports section of the `app.main.ts` file:

```typescript
require('ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.js');
require('ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.worker.js');
require('ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/web/viewer.js');
```

3.e. (Webpack and JHipster users only) Open the freshly copied pdf.js file, locate the function `webpackUniversalModuleDefinition()` and replace the first ten lines by this version:

```typescript
(function webpackUniversalModuleDefinition(root, factory) {
  if(typeof exports === 'object' && typeof module === 'object')
    module.exports = factory();
  else if(typeof define === 'function' && define.amd)
    define("pdfjs-dist/build/pdf", [], factory);
  else if(typeof exports === 'object')
    exports["pdfjs-dist/build/pdf"] = factory();
  // else <-- delete line
  window["pdfjs-dist/build/pdf"] = root["pdfjs-dist/build/pdf"] = root.pdfjsLib = factory(); // <-- modified line
})(this, function() {
```

4.  Add "NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule" to the import section of your module file. If your IDE doesn't find
    the import automatically, here it is:

            import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

5.  Now you can display the PDF file like so:

```html
<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'" useBrowserLocale="true" height="80vh"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

If you are using JHipster, note there's no `assets` folder, so most like the path of the URL is something like `[src]="'content/example.pdf'"`.

6. If you want to display a PDF file you have downloaded from a server, you probably have a `Blob` instead of an URL. Since version 0.9.21, you can pass this Blob directly to the `src` attribute. Until 0.9.20, you can use `URL.createObjectURL()` to convert this `Blob` into something the PDF viewer can display:

```html
<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="currentPdf"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

```typescript
public currentPdf: DOMString = null;

set src(input: Blob) {
  this.currentPdf = URL.createObjectURL(input);
}
```

## Configuration

Do you miss a configuration option? File an issue on the [project bug tracker](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ExploringAngular/tree/master/embedding-pdf). If the base library [pdf.js] supports the requested option, I'll probably add it. BTW, you can speed up the process by providing a code snippet telling me how to implement the feature.

_Legend:_

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

You can set it to "true" to allow for anchor tags like "#page=23" or "#nameddest=chapter_3". Only activate this flag if you don't use the anchor to encode the URLs for the router.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Most users can let this parameter safely at it's default value of zero. Set this to 1000 or higher if you run into timing problems (typically caused by loading the locale files after the PDF files, so they are not available when the PDF viewer is initialized).                                                                                                                                 |

If you pass the wrong password, a red error message claiming "corrupt pdf file" is show in below the toolbar. Caveat: the password must be a string. During my test I accidentially used a numerical value. This fails even if the password consists only of digits. Please not that the password is stored main memory without encryption.

If not undefined: Set the zoom level of the page, no matter which zoom level was previously configured. Legal values are [zoom]="'auto'", ="'page-actual'", ="'page-fit'", ="'page-width'", or ="50" (or any other percentage). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. [(zoom)]="zoomAttribute" updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom accross multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document. |

## Searching programmatically

The service `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService` allows you to search programmatically. If the PDF viewer hasn't been initialized, or if it has already been destroyed, calling the service results in an error message on the console.

| findNext(): boolean        | finds the next search result. Only call it after calling find() first. If the PDF viewer is not initialized, the method returns `false` and prints an error message on the console.     |
| findPrevious(): boolean    | finds the previous search result. Only call it after calling find() first. If the PDF viewer is not initialized, the method returns `false` and prints an error message on the console. |

## Internationalization

### Slow default way

If you add the translation files to your project as described above in step 3, the PDF viewer uses the browser language setting to determine which language to load. First, it loads the `locale.properties`, scans it for the desired language files, and loads the language file from the corresponding folder. That's two additional (and even consecutive) HTTP calls. That's slow, and it may even lead to errors if the network is already congested loading other resource files.

Don't forget to set the attribute `useBrowserLocale="true"` if you follow this approach.

### Slow way with custom translation files

If you want to use the slow way, but prefer to load the language files from a different URL, add a link to your application like so:

```html
<link rel="resource" type="application/l10n" href="https://www.example.com/locale/locale.properties" />
```

In this case, don't set `useBrowserLocale` (or set it explicitely to false).

### Inlining (aka embedding) the language files

Alternatively, you can provide the translations as a Json file. This Json file has to be part of the HTML page, like so:

```html
<script type="application/l10n">
  {"default_locale":"de","locales":{"de": ... }}
</script>
```

The folder `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/inline-locale-files` contains snippet files you can simply copy into your HTML page.
(As of version 0.3.0 - 0.9.5, there's only the German translation - other languages are following soon).

_Hint_: Sometimes you do not need to copy the HTML snippet into the index.html at the root folder of the Angular project. The bottom line is that the HTML snippet is already part of the DOM when the PDF viewer is initialized. Cluttering the root index file with the translations is an ugly and inflexible hack, but it works.

If you're using the "inline" approach, don't set `useBrowserLocale` (or set it explicitely to false).

If you can't avoid to do so, add the global CSS rule `.body .toolbar { z-index: 0; }`. The PDF viewer works without the z-index of the toolbar. The only difference is that the shadow of the toolbar is hidden by the PDF document.                                                                      |

Use media queries to hide the unwanted UI elements. For example, use something like `@media print { #modal-error-dialog: display none; }`.                                                              |

## Building the library from scratch (and updating to the latest version of Mozilla's pdf.js)

Have a look at https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/master/README.md. That's a very long list of steps, but that shouldn't stop you. I've tried to jot down every single action as meticulously as possible. So chances are you can update the library to a newer version of Mozilla's pdf.js but just following all these steps. If you do, please consider going the extra mile and submitting a pull request to this project.

## License and Kudos

The library is based on https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js, which has been published under an Apache V2 license.

Hence the licence of the ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is the Apache V2 license, too.
